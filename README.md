# Research question: What are the financial impacts of Fair Work Week legislation on workers?

Ideas:
- Main outcomes: Income volatility, income level, consumption, savings
- Identification: DiD or DiDiD with cross-industry and cross-state variation
- Heterogeneity: Female (disparities in child care), low wealth (liquidity constrained), early-career (least bargaining power)
- Extensive vs. intensive margin: Are results driven by people switching jobs (new at_counterparty) or income changes within job (same at_counterparty)
- Can I detect presence of children? ideas: infer from EIP payments, dollars spent on child products (do MCC codes go granular enough?)

Future project:
-if income volatility is affected, can use this to instrument for volatility stabilization to look at child outcomes
